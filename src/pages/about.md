## Hello World!

![](/portrait.png)

My name is Graham Hall, a web developer from Rhode Island.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually enjoying one of my other hobbies; video games, music, hiking, photography, art, the list goes on...

I write about web development on [my other blog](https://ghall.dev/blog), but I wanted an outlet to write about some of my other interests. So, I put together this site to share whatever's on my mind about the world of tech, gaming, life, whatever strikes my fancy.

If you want to get in touch, I'm on [Mastodon](https://home.social/@ghalldev).
